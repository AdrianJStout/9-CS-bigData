- Graphs are important when a human needs a visualisation of a large data set. 
- In this lesson, we're going to investigate climate change in the UK since about 1910, and you'll be able to draw your own conclusions about global warming.
- Before we get too carried away, we'll start by drawing a simple line graph and then build up to something more elaborate.
- Load up IDLE, start a new program (File -> New) and copy the code below into the window:

#+begin_src python   
# matplotlib - the Python graph-drawing library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy

# Set the X and Y values (same number of elements in both lists)
yVals= [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
xVals= [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]

# Plot the graph line
plt.plot(xVals,yVals)

# Add some labels
plt.xlabel('x axis')
plt.ylabel('y axis')
plt.title('Graph title goes here')

# Show the finished graph
plt.show()
#+end_src 

- One of the great things with Python is its ability to import [[https://xkcd.com/353/][new functionality]] to give it new abilities, like drawing graphics, playing sound, drawing graphs, performing complex mathematics and so on. 
- Our program starts by importing a graph-drawing library. This contains extra functions that Python doesn't normally have. 
- We then set the values we want to assign to the X and Y axes. 
    - I've plotted a little bit of the y = x^2 graph, from x=0 to 11. 
- We get Python to plot the actual graph
- And we then add labels to the X and Y axis.
- Finally, we ask Python to show the graph. 
- *Try it:* Change some of the values, and plot a different line.

- As part of a drive to be more transparent, the UK Government have released a little over 25000 raw data sets for anyone to access. You can browse them [[http://data.gov.uk/data/search][here]].
- We'll look at some climate data from the met office (the UK weather agency). The latest versions of their datasets can  be freely downloaded from their site [[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets][here]].
- I've picked up the historic mean temperature for the UK, but you can work on any location you're interested in. 
- Scientists believe that in general, the World is getting hotter over time due to the burning of fossil fuels. We'll write a short program to analyse the data from one weather station and see if we can spot a pattern.
- Our data looks like [[./img/uk.txt][this]] when you download it.
- Put this code into a new program

#+begin_src python   
# Python graph-drawing with matplotlib.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import csv

# Open the data file, and read the data in.
with open("uk.txt", 'r') as csvfile:
    reader=csv.reader(csvfile,delimiter=' ',skipinitialspace=True)
    data=list(reader)
    # Remove the first row, which has the column headers in it.
    data.pop(0)

# Pick up the individual rows, one by one.
for eachYear in range (0,len(data)):
    thisYr=data[eachYear]   # thisYear is a single year's data.
    whichYr=thisYr[0] # whichYr is the year we're looking at (e.g. 1960)

    # Trim off the year (we don't want to plot that)
    thisYr.pop(0)
    # Trim off the last 5 records (these are Season averages)
    del thisYr[len(thisYr)-5:len(thisYr)]

    # Plot the line for that year.
    plt.plot(thisYr,label=whichYr)
    
# then add some labels
plt.ylabel('Mean temperature')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.title('Mean temperatures, 1910-2014')
# legend = plt.legend(loc='lower center', shadow=True, fontsize='x-small')

# and show the finished graph
plt.show()
#+end_src 

- We've got over a century of weather data here. Each line represents a year's average temperature. We've commented out the 'legend=' line, as if we didn't (try un-commenting it), it obscures the graph. 
- On the x-axis, January is month 0, February is 1, December is 11. 
- Ignoring that you can't tell which year is which (at the moment), could you make any conclusions about what the graph shows? Examples could be:
     - The hottest mean temperature ever was in July, and was about 17.5 degrees. 
     - The weather starts getting warmer after February.
     - Can you think of some others?

- We set out to look at climate change. 
- As we've got so many data points, its hard to see which line corresponds to which year. We could do with seeing less data.
